# CaptivaGoogleCustomOCR
Custom Google OCR Engine for Captiva Advanced Recognition

You must first create a GCP Account and Enable the Vision APIs


This project uses the Opentext Intelligent Capture OCR SDK to integrate with the public cloud version of the Google Vision OCR engine.

This works with both fulltext and zonal OCR.
The solution must be compiled to the binnt directory of intelligent capture.
You can then create a custom OCR engine in Recognition Designer.
